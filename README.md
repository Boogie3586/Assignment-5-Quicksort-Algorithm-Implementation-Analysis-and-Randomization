# Quicksort Algorithm: Deterministic vs Randomized Implementation and Analysis

##  Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of the **Quicksort algorithm**, including both:
- A **deterministic version** (last-element pivot)
- A **randomized version** (pivot selected randomly)

It also includes:
- Empirical performance tests on different input types (random, sorted, reverse-sorted)
- A comprehensive report detailing implementation, theoretical analysis, and results

This assignment is part of **MSCS 532: Design and Analysis of Algorithms**.
